# Changelog

These are the changes since the release of MakeHuman 1.2.0. 

## 1.1.0

* The number of subdivisons on import is now configurable
* There is a new setting for applying extra tweaks for slotted body materials (only relevant when also having checked "Enhanced skin material", "Extra vertex groups" and "Slots for extra groups")

## 1.0.0

This is the same as "0.7.0" which was bundled with MakeHuman 1.2.0. We had planned to put the version stamp before the release but forgot.
